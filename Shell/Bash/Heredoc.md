# hash heredoc
## Syntax

```sh
[COMMAND] <<[-] 'DELIMITER'
  HERE-DOCUMENT
DELIMITER
```

-   The first line starts with an optional command followed by the special redirection operator `<<` and the delimiting identifier.
    -   You can use any string as a delimiting identifier, the most commonly used are EOF or END.
    -   If the delimiting identifier is unquoted, the shell will substitute all variables, commands and special characters before passing the here-document lines to the command.
    -   Appending a minus sign to the redirection operator `<<-`, will cause all leading tab characters to be ignored. This allows you to use indentation when writing here-documents in shell scripts. Leading whitespace characters are not allowed, only tab.
-   The here-document block can contain strings, variables, commands and any other type of input.
-   The last line ends with the delimiting identifier. White space in front of the delimiter is not allowed.

## Example
### Quote delimiter

 If the delimiting identifier is unquoted, the shell will substitute all variables, commands and special characters before passing the here-document lines to the command.

```sh
cat << EOF
The current working directory is: $PWD
You are logged in as: $(whoami)
EOF
```

=> Output:

```output
The current working directory is: /home/linuxize
You are logged in as: linuxize
```

### Unquote delimiter

 If the delimiting identifier is unquoted, the shell will not  substitute all variables, commands and special characters before passing the here-document lines to the command.

```sh
cat <<- "EOF"
The current working directory is: $PWD
You are logged in as: $(whoami)
EOF
```

=> Output: 
```output
The current working directory is: $PWD
You are logged in as: $(whoami)
```

### Writing output to file

Instead of displaying the output on the screen you can redirect it to a file using the `>`, `>>` operators.

```sh
cat << EOF > file.txt
The current working directory is: $PWD
You are logged in as: $(whoami)
EOF
```

If the file.txt doesnâ€™t exist it will be created. When using `>` the file will be overwritten, while the `>>` will append the output to the file.

### Piping output

```sh
cat <<'EOF' |  sed 's/l/e/g' > file.txt
Hello
World
EOF
```
